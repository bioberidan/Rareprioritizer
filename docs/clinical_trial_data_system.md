# Clinical Trials Data System Documentation

## Overview

The Clinical Trials Data System is a comprehensive ETL pipeline designed to systematically collect, process, and analyze clinical trial data for rare diseases from ClinicalTrials.gov. The system processes 665 rare diseases from the Orpha taxonomy and provides structured data for research prioritization decisions.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Data Source Management
- **Source Database**: ClinicalTrials.gov API
- **Disease Taxonomy**: Orpha.net taxonomy (665 diseases)
- **Filtering Logic**: Disease/Malformation syndrome types only
- **Geographic Focus**: Spain-based trials

#### 2. ETL Pipeline
```
Disease Extraction → Clinical Trials Processing → Data Aggregation → Query Interface → Statistical Analysis
```

#### 3. Data Flow Architecture
```
Orpha Taxonomy (999 diseases)
    ↓ [Filter by disorder type]
diseases_simple.json (665 diseases)
    ↓ [ETL Processing]
Per-disease JSON files (data/preprocessing/clinical_trials/)
    ↓ [Aggregation]
Consolidated datasets (data/processed/clinical_trials/)
    ↓ [Query Interface]
Research Applications
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Disease Extraction (`etl/extract_diseases.py`)

**Purpose**: Extract and filter diseases from Orpha taxonomy
**Input**: `data/processed/orpha/ordo/instances/diseases.json`
**Output**: `data/input/etl/init_diseases/diseases_simple.json`

**Filtering Criteria**:
- Include: `disorder_type` in ["Disease", "Malformation syndrome"]
- Exclude: "Clinical subtype", "Etiological subtype"
- Result: 665 diseases from 999 total

**Data Structure**:
```json
[
  {
    "disease_name": "PMM2-CDG",
    "orpha_code": "79318"
  },
  {
    "disease_name": "Marfan syndrome",
    "orpha_code": "272"
  }
]
```

### 2. Clinical Trials API Client (`utils/clinical_trials/clinical_trials.py`)

**Purpose**: Interface with ClinicalTrials.gov API
**Source**: Based on `trash_code/clinicaltrials_disease_search_dev.py`

**Key Methods**:
- `_search_trials()`: Primary search method
- `search_by_disease_name()`: Disease name search
- `search_by_orphacode()`: Orphan code search
- `search_comprehensive()`: Combined search strategies

**Search Parameters**:
- `query_term`: Disease name
- `query_locn`: "Spain" (fixed)
- `filter_overall_status`: ['RECRUITING', 'ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING']
- `max_results`: 100 per disease

### 3. ETL Processing (`etl/process_clinical_trials.py`)

**Purpose**: Process diseases through clinical trials API with run management

**Key Features**:
- Sequential processing (no parallelism)
- Per-disease run numbering
- Error handling and logging
- Progress tracking

**Processing Logic**:
```python
for disease in diseases:
    run_number = get_next_run_number("clinical_trials", disease.orpha_code)
    if not is_disease_processed(disease.orpha_code, "clinical_trials", run_number):
        results = api_client._search_trials(
            query_term=disease.disease_name,
            query_locn="Spain",
            filter_overall_status=['RECRUITING', 'ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING'],
            max_results=100
        )
        save_processing_result(results, "clinical_trials", disease.orpha_code, run_number)
```

**Output Structure**:
```
data/preprocessing/clinical_trials/
├── 79318/                               # PMM2-CDG
│   ├── run1_disease2clinical.json
│   └── run2_disease2clinical.json       # If run1 was empty
├── 272/                                 # Marfan syndrome
│   └── run1_disease2clinical.json
└── processing_log.json
```

### 4. Run Management (`utils/pipeline/run_management.py`)

**Purpose**: Universal run management across data types

**Key Functions**:
- `get_next_run_number()`: Check existing runs and return next number
- `is_disease_processed()`: Check if disease processed in current run
- `create_output_path()`: Generate output path for results
- `save_processing_result()`: Save results to appropriate location

**Run Logic**:
- Each disease maintains independent run sequence
- Empty runs trigger automatic reprocessing (run2, run3, etc.)
- Failed diseases don't stop overall processing

### 5. Data Aggregation (`etl/aggregate_clinical_trials.py`)

**Purpose**: Consolidate per-disease/per-run data into unified structures

**Strategy**: Latest non-empty run selection to avoid data loss

**Output Files** (in `data/processed/clinical_trials/`):
- `diseases2clinical_trials.json`: Disease → Clinical Trials mapping
- `clinical_trials2diseases.json`: Clinical Trial → Diseases mapping
- `clinical_trials_index.json`: Master index of all unique trials
- `processing_summary.json`: Processing statistics and metadata

### 6. Query Interface (`etl/clinical_trials_cont.py`)

**Purpose**: OrphaTaxonomy-style interface with lazy loading

**Architecture**:
- LRU caching for performance
- On-demand data loading
- Rich query methods
- Cross-referencing capabilities

**Key Query Methods**:
```python
controller = ClinicalTrialsController()

# Basic queries
trials = controller.get_trials_for_disease("646")
diseases = controller.get_diseases_for_trial("NCT12345678")

# Filtered queries
spanish_trials = controller.search_trials_in_spain()
recruiting_trials = controller.search_trials_by_status("RECRUITING")

# Analytics
top_diseases = controller.get_diseases_with_most_trials(10)
stats = controller.get_statistics()
```

## Data Models

### Pydantic Models (`data/models/disease.py`)

```python

# 2. Process clinical trials
python etl/process_clinical_trials.py

# 3. Aggregate results
python etl/aggregate_clinical_trials.py

# 4. Generate statistics
python apps/research_prioritization/stats/clinical_trials_stats.py
```

### Query Interface Usage
```python
from etl.clinical_trials_cont import ClinicalTrialsController

# Initialize controller
controller = ClinicalTrialsController()

# Basic disease lookup
trials = controller.get_trials_for_disease("646")  # Niemann-Pick disease
print(f"Found {len(trials)} trials for Niemann-Pick disease")

# Find most active diseases
top_diseases = controller.get_diseases_with_most_trials(10)
for disease in top_diseases:
    print(f"{disease['disease_name']}: {disease['trial_count']} trials")

# Geographic filtering
spanish_trials = controller.search_trials_in_spain()
print(f"Found {len(spanish_trials)} trials in Spain")

# Status filtering
recruiting_trials = controller.search_trials_by_status("RECRUITING")
print(f"Found {len(recruiting_trials)} recruiting trials")
```

### Research Applications
```python
# Gap analysis - diseases without trials
all_diseases = controller.get_all_diseases()
diseases_with_trials = controller.get_diseases_with_trials()
gap_diseases = [d for d in all_diseases if d not in diseases_with_trials]
print(f"Research gaps: {len(gap_diseases)} diseases without trials")

# Collaboration opportunities
high_activity_diseases = controller.get_diseases_with_most_trials(20)
for disease in high_activity_diseases:
    trials = controller.get_trials_for_disease(disease['orpha_code'])
    sponsors = set(trial.get('sponsor', 'Unknown') for trial in trials)
    print(f"{disease['disease_name']}: {len(sponsors)} unique sponsors")
```
