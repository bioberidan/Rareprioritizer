# Prioritization criteria with weights and mock settings
criteria:
  
  # Criterion 1: Prevalence and Population of Patients
  prevalence:
    path: "data/04_curated/orpha/orphadata"
    mock: false
    mock_value: 10.0  # Maximum score for mock
    weight: 0.20      # 20% weight as per SOW
    # Uses discrete scoring: ">1/1000"=10, "6-9/10000"=9, "1-5/10000"=8, 
    # "1-9/100000"=6, "1-9/1000000"=3, "<1/1000000"=2, "Unknown"=0
    
  # Criterion 2: Socioeconomic Impact
  socioeconomic:
    path: "data/02_preprocess/websearch"
    mock: true
    mock_value: 10.0  # Maximum score for mock (initial phase)
    weight: 0.20      # 20% weight as per SOW
    
  # Criterion 3: Approved Therapies (Drugs)
  orpha_drugs:
    path: "data/04_curated/orpha/orphadata"
    mock: false
    mock_value: 10.0  # Maximum score when no therapies exist
    weight: 0.25      # 25% weight as per SOW (highest importance)
    
  # Criterion 4: Clinical Trials in Spain
  clinical_trials:
    path: "data/04_curated/clinical_trials"
    mock: false
    mock_value: 0.0   # Default minimum score
    weight: 0.10      # 10% weight as per SOW
    
  # Criterion 5: Gene Therapy Traceability
  orpha_gene:
    path: "data/04_curated/orpha/orphadata"
    mock: false
    mock_value: 10.0  # Maximum score for monogenic diseases
    weight: 0.15      # 15% weight as per SOW
    # Scoring: monogenic (1 gene) = 10, polygenic (multiple genes) = 0, unknown = 0
    
  # Criterion 6: National Research Capacity (Groups)
  groups:
    path: "data/02_preprocess/websearch"
    mock: true
    mock_value: 10.0  # Maximum score for mock (initial phase)
    weight: 0.10      # 10% weight as per SOW

# Scoring configuration
scoring:
