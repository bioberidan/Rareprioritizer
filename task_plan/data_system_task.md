# Task Plan: Create Data_system.md - General Data Architecture Overview

## Clarified Requirements

**Purpose**: General overview for developers and LLM to understand data flow and handling across compartments
**Audience**: Developers and LLM (AI systems)  
**Scope**: General architecture of data processing, ingestion, and serving
**Level**: High-level architectural overview, not detailed implementation
**Future**: Specific data systems (prevalence, drugs, clinical trials) will be separate documents

## Analysis Summary

After examining the actual codebase, I need to focus on the **general data architecture patterns** rather than specific pipeline implementations. The system uses consistent architectural patterns across different data domains.

## Discovered General Architecture Patterns

### Core Architectural Characteristics:
- **Modular ETL Design**: Consistent processing patterns across data types
- **Run-based Processing**: Universal run management with automatic retry logic
- **Controller Query Layer**: Standardized data access interfaces with caching
- **Separated Concerns**: Clear separation between ingestion, processing, and serving
- **Data Validation**: Pydantic models for schema enforcement throughout
- **Cross-system Integration**: Shared components and consistent patterns

### Universal Data Processing Pattern:
```
Data Sources → ETL Processing → Storage → Aggregation → Query Interface → Applications
```

### Key Architectural Components:
- **ETL Infrastructure**: Standardized extraction, transformation, and loading
- **Run Management System**: Universal processing orchestration
- **Data Storage Zones**: Organized data progression through processing stages
- **Query Controllers**: Consistent data access layer with performance optimization
- **Validation Framework**: Schema and data quality enforcement
- **Integration Layer**: API access and cross-system analysis capabilities

## Key Implementation Examples

### Run Management Pattern
```python
# Universal pattern used across all data processing
run_number = get_next_run_number(data_type, entity_id)
if not is_entity_processed(entity_id, data_type, run_number):
    results = process_entity(entity_id)
    save_processing_result(results, data_type, entity_id, run_number)
```

### Controller Pattern
```python
# Standardized query interface with caching
@lru_cache(maxsize=1000)
def get_data_for_entity(entity_id: str) -> Optional[Dict]:
    return self._load_data(entity_id)
```

### Data Validation Pattern
```python
# Pydantic models for type safety
class ProcessingResult(BaseModel):
    entity_id: str
    data: Dict
    processing_timestamp: datetime
    run_number: int
```

## Next Steps

1. **Create general Data_system.md** focusing on architectural patterns
2. **Emphasize reusable components** and design principles
3. **Document data flow patterns** across compartments
4. **Include architectural examples** without specific implementation details
5. **Ensure extensibility** for future data system additions

## Success Criteria

The final `Data_system.md` should:
- [ ] Provide clear understanding of general data architecture
- [ ] Explain data flow patterns across system compartments
- [ ] Document reusable architectural components
- [ ] Serve as a foundation for understanding specific data systems
- [ ] Be useful for developers and LLM to understand the overall design
- [ ] Focus on ingestion, processing, and serving patterns
- [ ] Avoid specific pipeline implementations (those will be separate docs)
