# Prevalence Prediction System: From Birth to Point Prevalence

## Executive Summary

This document presents a comprehensive analysis and design for a machine learning system that predicts **point prevalence** from **prevalence at birth** for rare diseases. Based on analysis of the ORPHA prevalence database, we have identified 2,063 birth prevalence records and 7,890 point prevalence records that can be paired for predictive modeling.

**Key Findings:**
- **Available Pairs**: ~300-500 diseases have both birth and point prevalence data
- **Data Quality**: 86.7% of records are reliable (≥6.0 reliability score)
- **Optimal Format**: JSON for complex analysis, CSV for model training
- **Recommended Method**: Multiple regression with geographic and temporal factors
- **Expected Performance**: R² ~0.7-0.85 based on biological relationships

## 1. Current Data Analysis

### 1.1 Prevalence Data Overview

From the processed ORPHA dataset (`data/03_processed/orpha/orphadata/orpha_prevalence/`):

```
Total prevalence records: 16,420
├── Point prevalence: 7,890 (48.1%)
├── Prevalence at birth: 2,063 (12.6%)
├── Annual incidence: 3,064 (18.7%)
├── Cases/families: 3,355 (20.4%)
└── Lifetime prevalence: 48 (0.3%)
```

### 1.2 Data Quality Assessment

**Reliability Distribution:**
- Validated records: 14,520 (88.4%)
- Reliable records (≥6.0 score): 14,241 (86.7%)
- High confidence estimates: 6,412 records with class midpoint calculations

**Geographic Coverage:**
- Worldwide: 8,835 records (53.8%)
- Regional coverage: 167 countries/regions
- European focus: 1,675 Europe-specific records

### 1.3 Paired Disease Identification

**Matching Strategy:**
```python
# Diseases with both birth and point prevalence
orpha_code -> {
    "birth_prevalence": [...],
    "point_prevalence": [...],
    "geographic_overlap": [...],
    "temporal_consistency": bool
}
```

**Estimated Pairs:**
- **Conservative estimate**: 300 diseases with reliable paired data
- **Optimistic estimate**: 500 diseases including moderate quality data
- **Quality filtering**: Focus on ≥8.0 reliability score gives ~200 high-quality pairs

```

### 2.2 Data Format Decision: JSON vs CSV

**Recommendation: Hybrid Approach**

**JSON Format** for complex analysis:
```json
{
  "orpha_code": "586",
  "disease_name": "Cystic fibrosis",
  "paired_data": {
    "birth_prevalence": {
      "per_million_estimate": 300.0,
      "reliability_score": 9.8,
      "geographic_area": "Ireland",
      "confidence_level": "high",
      "source": "32483343[PMID]"
    },
    "point_prevalence": {
      "per_million_estimate": 300.0,
      "reliability_score": 10.0,
      "geographic_area": "Ireland", 
      "confidence_level": "high",
      "source": "32483343[PMID]_ORPHANET"
    }
  },
  "features": {
    "disease_category": "metabolic",
    "age_dependency": "stable",
    "geographic_consistency": true,
    "survival_factor": 0.95
  }
}
```

**CSV Format** for model training:
```csv
orpha_code,disease_name,birth_prev,point_prev,reliability_avg,geo_match,survival_factor,age_stability
586,Cystic fibrosis,300.0,300.0,9.9,1,0.95,stable
213,Cystinosis,50.0,45.0,9.8,1,0.90,stable
```

### 2.3 Feature Engineering

**Primary Features:**
1. **Birth prevalence value** (per million)
2. **Disease category** (metabolic, genetic, etc.)
3. **Geographic consistency** (same region?)
4. **Age-related factors** (survival, late onset)
5. **Reliability score average**

**Derived Features:**
1. **Survival factor**: Point/Birth ratio for known stable diseases
2. **Age stability index**: Variance in prevalence across age groups
3. **Geographic specificity**: Population genetic factors
4. **Temporal consistency**: Year of study consistency

---

## 3. Machine Learning Methodology

### 3.1 Problem Formulation

**Regression Problem:**
```
point_prevalence = f(birth_prevalence, disease_features, geographic_factors, temporal_factors)
```

**Target Variable:** Point prevalence (per million)
**Primary Predictor:** Birth prevalence (per million)
**Context Variables:** Disease type, geography, reliability, temporal factors

### 3.2 Model Selection Analysis

#### 3.2.1 Simple Correlation Analysis
```python
correlation = point_prevalence.corr(birth_prevalence)
# Expected: r = 0.6-0.8 for stable diseases
```

**Pros:** Simple, interpretable, baseline
**Cons:** Ignores disease-specific factors, geographic variation

#### 3.2.2 Linear Regression (Recommended)
```python
point_prev = β₀ + β₁(birth_prev) + β₂(disease_type) + β₃(geography) + β₄(reliability) + ε
```

**Advantages:**
- Interpretable coefficients
- Handles multiple factors
- Established medical precedent
- Confidence intervals for predictions

**Expected Performance:** R² = 0.7-0.85

#### 3.2.3 Advanced Methods

**Multiple Regression with Interactions:**
```python
point_prev = β₀ + β₁(birth_prev) + β₂(birth_prev × disease_type) + β₃(geography) + ε
```

**Random Forest:** For non-linear relationships
**Hierarchical Models:** Account for geographic clustering

### 3.3 Validation Strategy

**Cross-Validation Approach:**
1. **Geographic stratification**: Train on some regions, test on others
2. **Disease-type stratification**: Train on metabolic, test on genetic
3. **Temporal validation**: Train on older studies, test on recent

**Performance Metrics:**
- **R²**: Proportion of variance explained
- **RMSE**: Root mean squared error (per million)
- **MAPE**: Mean absolute percentage error
- **Clinical accuracy**: ±50% prediction tolerance

## 6. Technical Implementation Details

### 6.1 Pairwise Analysis Approach

**Algorithm:**
```python
def create_prevalence_pairs():
    # Group by orpha_code
    disease_groups = prevalence_data.groupby('orpha_code')
    
    pairs = []
    for orpha_code, group in disease_groups:
        birth_records = group[group.prevalence_type == 'Prevalence at birth']
        point_records = group[group.prevalence_type == 'Point prevalence']
        
        if len(birth_records) > 0 and len(point_records) > 0:
            # Create all combinations
            for birth in birth_records:
                for point in point_records:
                    if validate_pair(birth, point):
                        pairs.append(create_pair(birth, point))
    
    return pairs

def validate_pair(birth_record, point_record):
    # Geographic consistency
    geo_match = birth_record.geographic_area == point_record.geographic_area
    
    # Reliability threshold
    min_reliability = min(birth_record.reliability_score, point_record.reliability_score)
    
    # Temporal consistency (within 10 years)
    temporal_consistency = abs(birth_record.year - point_record.year) <= 10
    
    return geo_match and min_reliability >= 8.0 and temporal_consistency
```

### 6.2 Model Training Pipeline

**Cross-Validation Strategy:**
```python
def geographic_cv_split(data, n_folds=5):
    """Split by geographic regions to test generalizability"""
    regions = data.geographic_area.unique()
    region_folds = np.array_split(regions, n_folds)
    
    for test_regions in region_folds:
        train_mask = ~data.geographic_area.isin(test_regions)
        yield data[train_mask], data[~train_mask]

def disease_type_cv_split(data, n_folds=5):
    """Split by disease categories"""
    # Similar approach for disease types
```

**Feature Selection:**
```python
def select_features(X, y):
    # Correlation analysis
    correlations = X.corrwith(y)
    
    # Variance inflation factor
    vif = calculate_vif(X)
    
    # Clinical relevance scoring
    clinical_scores = score_clinical_relevance(X.columns)
    
    return select_optimal_features(correlations, vif, clinical_scores)
```

### 6.3 Uncertainty Quantification

**Prediction Intervals:**
```python
def predict_with_uncertainty(model, X_new):
    # Point prediction
    y_pred = model.predict(X_new)
    
    # Prediction interval using residual std
    residual_std = calculate_residual_std(model, X_train, y_train)
    
    # Confidence intervals
    lower_bound = y_pred - 1.96 * residual_std
    upper_bound = y_pred + 1.96 * residual_std
    
    return {
        'prediction': y_pred,
        'lower_95': lower_bound,
        'upper_95': upper_bound,
        'std_error': residual_std
    }
```
